# SIPP_project

Data is taken form the [Survey Of Income And Program Participation (SIPP)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html). <br>
Due to size of the dataset not all columns can be read on usual computers. <br>
Right now only data for 2018 is considered.

Aim of this project is to estimate risk prefrences for health insurance contracts based on structureal econometric models.
